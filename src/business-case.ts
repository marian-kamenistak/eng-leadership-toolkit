Problem to fix: ${problem}

The formula:
(attrition avoided + cost of delay avoided + team lift) / 2, compared against the pack price.
The halving is the CFO discount: assume mentoring only gets you half the value, and the case should still clear.

Total value at stake: ${eur(total)}
After the CFO discount (/2): ${eur(discounted)}
Pack price: ${eur(PACK_PRICE_EUR)} (${PACK_SESSIONS} sessions x ${SESSION_PRICE_EUR} EUR company rate, without VAT, invoiced with PO from ELC Hub s.r.o.)
ROI multiple: ${roiMultiple}x${zeroNote}

For scale: one prevented mis-hire pays for 20 quarters of mentoring.

Subject: Budget ask: leadership mentoring, 1,752 EUR, measured in 90 days

Hi [manager name],

I want to fix one thing this quarter: ${problem}.

The ask: ${eur(PACK_PRICE_EUR)} for ${PACK_SESSIONS} mentoring sessions over 3 months with Marian Kamenistak (marian.coach, 3,400+ sessions with 300+ engineering leaders since 2019). ${SESSION_PRICE_EUR} EUR per session, company rate, without VAT, invoiced with a PO from ELC Hub s.r.o.

${emailStakes}

How we measure it, on paper before session 1:
${emailKpis}

Guardrails: KPIs agreed upfront, mid-point review at session 3, final review at session 6, the intro call is free, and any session rated under 7/10 is not charged.

If the KPIs do not move in 90 days, we stop. Can I get a yes this week?

[your name]`;
