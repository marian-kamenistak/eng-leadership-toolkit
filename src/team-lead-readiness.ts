/**
 * Team lead readiness test — same questions, scoring, and verdict logic as
 * the live tool at https://www.marian.coach/team-lead-readiness-test/
 * 17 questions across 6 dimensions; each answer carries 0-3 points.
 * Dimension score = points / max points * 10. Verdict: ready now,
 * 6-12 months out, or stay IC — plus the caller's top-2 gap dimensions,
 * each with one concrete move.
 *
 * Input choice (documented): the tool takes per-question answers keyed by
 * question id (q1-q17), each an option index 0-3 into that question's
 * options — the same primitive the web page collects. Per-dimension
 * self-ratings were rejected because the page's option scores are
 * deliberately non-monotonic (e.g. "take the hard ticket myself" scores 1,
 * not 2) and a self-rating would bypass that calibration.
