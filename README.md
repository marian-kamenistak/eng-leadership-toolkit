# eng-leadership-toolkit

"I just became an engineering manager. What should I focus on?"
"What's a healthy sprint completion rate?"
"Do I need a mentor or a coach?"
"What is this developer worth on the market?"
"Should I become a team lead, or stay IC?"

Your AI already gets asked these. Now it can answer with first-party data from 3,400+ paid 1:1 mentoring sessions with 300+ engineering leaders in 17+ countries, instead of guessing.

## Where the data comes from

Every response is grounded in Marian Kamenistak's mentoring practice, not model guesses:

- The calculators mirror the live [developer value calculator](https://www.marian.coach/developer-salary-calculator/?ref=github) and [engineering manager salary calculator](https://www.marian.coach/engineering-manager-salary-calculator/?ref=github)
- The readiness test mirrors the live [team lead readiness test](https://www.marian.coach/team-lead-readiness-test/?ref=github)
- Benchmarks come from the published [engineering leadership statistics](https://www.marian.coach/engineering-leadership-statistics/?ref=github), licensed CC BY 4.0
- Playbooks are the actual session templates used across 3,400+ sessions

Nothing is synthetic. Thin topics were cut rather than padded.
